TARGET OPTIMIZATION DIRECTION GUIDED TRANSFER LEARNING FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION ICASSP 2024
ABSTRACT
At present, deep learning has made impressive achievements
in various fields; however, effectively training deep neural
networks on small data sets remains a significant challenge.
Transfer learning, as a method of efficient training across multiple tasks, has been widely used to solve this problem. However, when the domain gap or the data volume difference between the two tasks is too large, the transfer learning may
not perform well, and other optimization methods will be required to improve the performance. In this paper, we propose
a new transfer learning method guided by the direction of objective optimization from the perspective of gradient. This
method guides the gradient direction of the source task towards the gradient direction of the target task. In several similar and conflicting tasks, this method has achieved good results in efficiency and performance. In comparison with other
transfer learning methods, the results shown by this method
are generally better.
