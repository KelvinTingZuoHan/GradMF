This is a torch implementation of the paper."TARGET OPTIMIZATION DIRECTION GUIDED TRANSFER LEARNING FOR IMAGE
CLASSIFICATION"
 by Kelvin Ting Zuo Han, Shengxuming Zhang, Gerard Marcos Freixas, Zunlei Feng, Cheng Jin.

In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning method guided by the direction of objective optimization from the perspective of gradient. This
method guides the gradient direction of the source task towards the gradient direction of the target task. In several similar and conflicting tasks, this method has achieved good results in efficiency and performance. In comparison with other transfer learning methods, the results shown by this method are generally better.
